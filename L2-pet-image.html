	<p>Your dog is a friend for life. Why not provide the best care possible?</p>
	<p>Make sure your pet has plenty of <i><b>fresh water</b></i> during hot weather.
	When takeing your dog on long walks, bring along a collapsible water dish and bottle
	water. You can find specialty water dishes at many pet supply stores for $10 or less.</p>
